### [v1.5.0-beta](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.5.0-beta-free)
- Added **High Quality Mode** for image rescaling, produces more consistent results across different paper / pen sizes and results in better quality plots.
- Added **Preferences Menu** - Much more finer control over settings in DBV3, with more settings on the way!
  - General Panel: Here you can change some DrawingBotV3 default settings, like default pfms, canvas colour, pen width, pfm presets etc.
  - User Interface: In this panel you can enable / disable rulers, drawing borders and notifications.
  - Export Settings: This is the new home for all your usual Export Settings.
  - NOTE: Search Function is currently limited, but will search settings individually too.
- Added: **'Directionality', 'Distortion', 'Angularity', 'Edge Power', 'Sobel Power', 'Luminance Power' and 'Squiggle Min Length'** to All Sketch PFMs
  - Directionality - forces the lines to follow the natural contours of the image
  - Distortion - adds some noise to the generated lines, creating more stylised images.
  - Angularity - higher angularity results in lines which don't change direction as frequently, resulting in more sweeping curves in curve pfms
  - Edge Power - used to exaggerate key edges in the image
  - Sobel Power - used to exaggerate a cartoonish quality for the plot
  - Luminance Power - typically PFMs will follow dark areas in the image when creating lines, this slider can be used to decrease the influence of brightness which in turn will favour other style options like Directionarity or Edge Power etc.
  - Squiggle Min Length - prevents incredibly short squiggles from being created, shortening plotting times - thanks to HanzPetrov
- Added: "Connected Lines" - Option to Spiral PFM - creating one continuous polyline for the spiral, massively reducing the amount of pen lifts required.
- Added: "Pen Force" to HPGL Presets for use with the HP 7550
- Added: 'Curve Offset' options to Cubic Beziers and Quad Beziers - These options allow you to control the 'wiggle' of the curve
- Added: Notifications (W.I.P) - Pop-Ups to show you additional information when images are imported / files are exported.

- Improved: **Cubic Beziers Rewrite** - the cubic beziers PFM has been re-written and now can create much higher quality curves
- Improved: Speed Improvements to Sketch PFMs especially up to **x3 quicker** for larger images
- Improved: Sketch PFMs now use a more accurate erasing method, this results in a slower processing time, but better quality lines.
- Improved: Exporting files of the same name, will now have automatically incremented names e.g. name_1, name_2 etc.
- Improved: The pens in the drawing will now be re-distributed when the shapes range slider is adjusted.
- Improved: PFM Controls now have category headings which can be collapsed, this helps to show the relationship between settings and makes it easier to find them again.
- Improved: Settings panels can now be dragged and dropped, you can drag them to be on the right hand side of the viewport, or drag them over the viewport to undock them, you can also drag them over each other to swap them.
- Improved: The user interface layout will now be saved on exit & restored with projects (this can be configured in preferences)
- Improved: The main settings panel can now be resized horizontally.
- Improved: When undocked individual settings tabs can be resized horizontally & vertically.
- Improved: When changing Input Units in the Drawing Area panel, the values will automatically update
- Improved: New icons and options in the File Menu.

### [v1.4.1-beta](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.4.1-beta-free)
- Added: **Colour Match - Premium Only** - A new Colour Seperation mode for Sketch PFMs only, it will compare the pens in your drawing set to the colours in the image and when drawing will try to use the best matched pen.
  You also have a few options to configure colour match further, found to the right of the Colour Seperation drop-down.
  
  - "Colour Accuracy" - Decreasing the Colour Accuracy will lower the quality of the colour match and allows pens to draw over areas where they have a higher colour difference. Colour Accuracy relates to a Delta-E colour measurement in the following way
    - 100: No colour difference
    - 99: Slight colour difference     
    - 98: Small colour difference     
    - 97: Medium colour difference
    - 96: Large colour difference
    - 95: Very large colour difference
  
  - "Brightness Multiplier" - Decreases the overlap of the pens in the image
  - "Pen Limit" - Limits the number of pens which can be used when matching, if this value is set to 18, only the 18 best matched pens will be used. If this value is set to 0, there is no limit.
  - "Use Canvas Colour" - Adds an invisible pen which matches the colour of the Canvas, helps to avoid drawing unnecessary lines.    
  - "Line Density - from Sketch PFMs" - the line density control found in the Sketch PFMs can also be used to control the Colour Match output.
  - **For the best results**
    - Use all the pens of a specific manufacturer, i.e. Use the presets for the set of 60 Staedtler Fineliners, then use the Pen Limit feature, to limit selection to approx 18+ pens allowing colour match to choose your best matched pens for each plot.
    - Use a bright, saturated image, murky images or ones with a limited colour palette will perform poorly.    
- Added: **SVG Import & SVG Converter PFM - Premium Only**
  - You can now import SVGs generated in other softwares or in DrawingBotV3, this opens up many possibilities, such as SVG cropping, rotation, flipping, masking, pen/layer reassignment, layering multiple SVGs and recovering old DBV3 projects. Note: Any text in the SVGs will be blank, you should use "Object to Path" in Inkscape before importing SVGs with text.
  - SVGs can be also be treated like any other image allowing them to be run through any PFM, they will be rasterised at the highest quality possible before plotting (the image tab will show a low quality preview of the SVG).
  - You can control the conversion process in the new PFM SVG Converter, it has a few settings.
      - SVG Path: The path to the SVG to be used, if this isn't set it will use the current imported SVG, if there isn't one the PFM will produce no output. You can however use this PFM as part of a Layers PFM, to layer SVGs together, when you run the PFM like this you can set the SVG Path to use an SVG which hasn't been imported.
      - Derive Drawing Set: When enabled DrawingBotV3 will generate a new Drawing Pen for each colour in the SVG, allowing you to access them each as layers. This opens up possibilities for splitting SVGs by colour using a per/layer export, or even re-assigning colours to your SVG, once the SVG Converter PFM has been run you'll have access to change the colour of lines with all the tools available with a default drawing.
  - You can also import an SVG to run through a standard PFM
 
- Added: **Masking - Premium Only** - A new useful settings tab, to allow you to mask areas of the image, you can add shapes masks such as Rectangles and Circles, you can move, resize, rotate, skew with the controls in the viewport area. You can also import SVGs as masks, they will keep their original sizing so you can create detailed masks by importing an SVG with the same dimensions as in drawing area controls.
- Added: **Image Cropping** - You can now crop images in the Image Processing tab, this allows you to enter values in pixels for cropping the image. You can also hit the "Edit" button and this will display a resizable box in the viewport area which you can then move to create the desired crop. You can also access this cropping feature via the new Display Mode "Image Cropping".
- Added: **Rulers Overlays** - There are now rulers on the borders of the viewport area to show you an accurate scale of your drawing / image.
- Added: Lock 1:1 button to the viewport toolbar, to allow viewing drawings at the correct scale relative to the screen, useful for evaluating the density of your plot.
- Added: Reference Image exports - You can now export the edited reference image used in your plots, via Export / Export Reference Image File.
- Added: Winsor & Newton ProMarkers, Pens/Drawing Sets - led
- Added: Bic Cristal and Intensity, Pens/Drawing Sets - led
- Added: Staedtler Fineliner 305 Sky Blue - Pen Definition - led  
- Added: Support for Googles WebP Image Files (.webp)
- Added: Fullscreen Mode, you can enable it be going to View/Fullscreen Mode
- Added: Frame Hold Start and Frame Hold End to Animation Settings
- Changed: Increased default render quality in the viewport to x4 the previous quality
- Changed: You can now send any file type via the Serial Connection, allowing for sending GCode files to compatible plotters.
- Changed: Image Rotation / Flipping is now Image Specific, when you load a new image these values will be reset.
- Fixed: Drawings/Images flickering when switching Display Modes.
- Fixed: Serial Connection commands will now be executed properly on non-HPGL devices.
- Fixed: Staedtler Fineliner 63 Delft Blue - Pen Definition - led
- Fixed: Export Directory being used instead of Import Directory when importing files - led
- Fixed: Removed duplicate Copic Black Pens - led
- Fixed: "Original Sizing" preset not activating properly  
- Fixed: GCode Settings not saving properly
- Fixed: HP-GL Padding/Offsets creating inaccurate drawings outside of the HP-GL bounds
- Fixed: When exporting with N/Pens the render order will now be used rather than the export order, meaning the order will now match the generated HPGL files correctly.

### [v1.4.0-beta](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.4.0-beta-free)

Note: This update has kept growing and growing, and it’s time it was released, this is a Public Beta, although it has already been through an alpha testing phase.
- Added: New 9 new PFMS
    - **Adaptive Circular Scribbles (Beta)** – this is an implementation of Chiu Et Al 2015, “Tone‐ and Feature‐Aware Circular Scribble Art” – it generates one continuous circular scribble to represent the image. If you wish to achieve results similar to Chiu Et Al’s implementation use a size of paper, pen width which gives you a plotting size of 4000px on the largest edge then use the “Chiu Et Al – 4000px” preset
    - **Adaptive Shapes, Triangulation, Tree (Beta), Stippling, Dashes, Diagram, Adaptive TSP**, are all very similar to their Voronoi counterparts but give a much better representation of the tonality of the input image, they are also typically faster to run.
    - **Voronoi Dashes**, this variation of the new Adaptive Dashes PFM, but using the original Voronoi style.

- **Using Adaptive PFMS**
    - They love high resolution, high contrast images.
    - They are called "Adaptive" because they adapt to match the tone of the input image. This means the reproductions of tones is way more accurate then other PFMs, this means they have an additional processing stage "Tone Mapping". This process only needs to be performed once per configuration of settings, if you change a setting which could alter the tone map it will run again.
    - You can view the output of the tone mapping stage by selecting "Display:" and then "Tone Map", this shows you three outputs the Reference Tone Map, the drawing created by the PFM with the current settings and the blurred version of this output. If your blurred output reassembles the reference tone map v closely that's very good and if you find one which matches better then the current Adaptive Circular Scribbles settings let me know. If the tone map doesn't reassembly the image very closely don't worry DrawingBotV3 will account for this variance to create an image which better matches the tone map anyway.
- Added: Ability to have multiple Drawing Sets, you can then use different sets for each layer/tile in Layers PFM / Mosaic PFM.
    - Drawings Sets can be created and edited from the Pen Settings tab.
- Added: Colour Picker option when right clicking a Drawing Pen, then right-click anywhere in the viewport to set the pen’s colour.
- Added: Settings panels can now be undocked, and moved around independently, they can be re-docked by closing the window it hitting the link button again.
- Added: “Per/Group” export option, when using PFM Layers or any Mosaic PFM this option will export the individual layers/tiles individually
- Added: “Per N/Pens” export option, to allow drawings with multiple pens to be split into a certain number of pens. Useful when exporting for Vintage Plotters which have automatic pen changes.
- Added: “Layer Distribution” option to PFM Layers, which allows finer control over the distribution of pens between layers
    - NONE: Layers will be distributed seperately.
    - ORDERED PER PFM: Layers which use the same PFM and Drawing Set will be distributed together, treating the first layer as the darkest and the last layer as the brightest.
    - ORDERED: Same as the above, but only matches Drawing Sets
- Added: “Clipping Mode”, available in the Drawing Area, allows you to choose if shapes should overflow the edges of the drawing/page or not, this will only have an effect on some PFMS, as some PFMS only work within the image provided anyway. You have three options 
    - “Drawing” – Clip the geometries to the drawings edges
    - “Page” – Clip the geometries to the page’s edges
    - “None” – Allow geometries to overflow the page and drawing
- Added: Portrait/Landscape toggle to the Drawing Area to replace the “Rotate” button, this will remember the orientation you have chosen and keep this orientation when you select a new paper size.
- Improved: Voronoi PFMs are now multi-threaded and also have a new slider “Voronoi Accuracy”, an accuracy of 100% is the equivalent to the previous version 
- Improved: The OpenGL Renderer will now render while the drawing is being generated, the UI will also be much more responsive when it’s updating.
- Changed: When editing Drawing Sets while using Layers PFM / Mosaic PFM they will now live update without having to run the PFM again.
- Changed: Moved “Blend Mode” from Pen Settings to be above the Viewport
- Changed: Moved “Colour Seperation” to be part of Pen Settings
- Changed: Pen settings buttons Add/Remove/etc. now use symbols instead of text and have tool tips when hovered, to try and re-clutter the UI.
- Changed: If you open a project and DrawingBotV3 is unable to locate the original image used you will now be prompted to locate the image.
- Changed: The recommended Distribution Type will now be change based on the current settings.
- Changed: DrawingBotV3 will now remember the PFMs “preconfigured” distribution, so when creating drawings with CMYK seperation the distribution will not be forgotten when you switch back.
- Fixed: Some pop-up windows not closing when the main window is closed.
- Fixed: Mosaic PFMs and Layers PFM will now show their current progress properly.
- Fixed: Voronoi PFMs will now show their current progress properly.
- Fixed: HPGL Exports not having the correct offset
- Fixed: GCode Settings not loading correctly when switching presets
- Fixed: Custom version names not being saved with the project

- Added: New Hardware Accelerated Renderer, to activate go to Display Mode : "Drawing (Hardware Accelerated)"
- Added: "Squiggle Deviation" Slider to Sketch PFMs, this allows you to decide how far a squiggle is allowed to deviate in brightness before it is ended prematurely, this has the result of making shorter squiggles which are more accurate and less likely to cross over brighter areas of the image. 
- Added: "Unlimited Tests" Option to a few Sketch PFMs, this will run as many tests as required to find the "best" line possible, resulting in more accurate drawings with longer processing times.
- Added: "Curve Refinement" Option to Catmull-Roms, this will add an additional pass after the curves have been found to see if minor adjustments to the curves points will improve the accuracy.

### [v1.2.0-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.2.0-stable)
- Added: HPGL Export - Export your images to HPGL for sending to plotters.
    - You can configure your HPGL files with configurable Hard-Clip limits, X-Axis Mirror, Y-Axis Mirror, X-Axis Alignment, Y-Axis Alignment, Rotation, Curve Flatness, Pen Velocity and the initial Pen Number.
    - If you're inputted the Hard-Clip limits you can use "Auto" rotation, to position your image correctly for you so you don't need to worry about if it's landscape or portrait!
    - Choose from presets for different plotter models and paper sizes
    - When the export is complete you'll see a dialog indicating where pens should be loaded and the size of the HPGL File.
    - If the drawing exceeds the Plotter's Hard-Clip limits you'll be notified.
- Added: Serial Port Connection for Plotters! Send HPGL Files and commands directly from DrawingBotV3.
    - Allows you to set the Serial Port, Baud Rate, Data Bits, Stop Bits, Parity and Flow Control
    - Also including monitoring of the Progress, Bytes Sent, Elapsed Time, Remaining Time and the Plotters own buffer.
    - Sending can also be paused when needed and resumed.
    - Ability to detect the plotter being used and apply the recommended settings!
    - The serial port connection runs in a seperate thread so you can continue using DrawingBot while your Drawing is plotting.
    - It can also be used to send files not generated with DrawingBot and in fact will stream any .txt file over the serial port!
- Added: Video Import - You can now import videos and process every frame automatically
    - When you choose your export option this will apply to every frame in the video
- Added: Configurable Canvas Colour - HanzPetrov

### [v1.1.1-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.1.1-stable)
- Fixed: Previous iterations of Voronoi Diagrams showing up in SVG exports. (Random dots on the export)

### [v1.1.0-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.1.0-stable)
- Added: Three New Path Finding Modules Mosaic Custom, Voronoi Tree and Voronoi TSP.
  - "Mosaic Custom" - Allows you to create your own Custom Mosaic, using an image mask. 
    This opens up many creative possibilities combining the effects of multiple PFMs to create more complex pieces. 
    This is very easy to do, you first need to create an image mask in an image editor which has the same resolution as the original image which contains a unique block colour for each drawing style you plan to use.
    Then you can import this mask as one of the settings, and for each Drawing Style define a "Mask Colour" which matches the one you used in the mask image.
    You can also feather the mask in the settings.
  - "Voronoi Tree" - Creates a "Minimum Spanning Tree" using Prim's algorithm, using the points generated from a Weighted Voronoi Diagram, it creates artwork similar to the classic TSP art but in a fraction of the time.
  - "Voronoi TSP" - Creates a solution to the "Travelling Salesman Problem" for the points generated from a Weighted Vornoi Diagram, if you're serious about using this PFM with a high point count expect to wait many hours or days to get the final result, optimisations are very welcome! 
    There are currently 3 algorithms, a Lazy 2-Opt Approach which is very fast and inaccurate, then an implementation of the classic Lin-Kernighan, and an attempt to implement the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun algorithm. 2-Opt is the most stable and the one I recommend.
- Added: CMYK Configuration, next to the colour seperation drop-down you now have the option to configure the weighting of the CMYK plot to allow you to fine tune the density to your specific pens, as many users reported their K layer being too strong, the default for K is now x0.75. This option works with every PFM.
- Added: Video Exporting for Animations in both H.264 and ProRes 422.
- Changed: "Randomise" will now produce more stable results and should be able to run in most instances
- Changed: The min/max of a few key variables have been changed.
- Changed: Values can now be set outside of the range of the min/max for more advanced users, in some instances this may cause the plot to crash or not start at all.
- Changed: Some PFMs which had optimisation disabled by default will now have as a minimum geometry sorting enabled to reduce plotting times
- Changed: Mosaics now optimise the outputs of each tile individually to speed up optimisation times.
- Changed: Raster export dimensions will now be multiples of 2
- Fixed: Padding not being saved properly with Drawing Area presets.
- Fixed: De-activated pens being re-activated in presets
- Fixed: Voronoi Circles and Voronoi Diagram PFMs will now stay within the bounds of the image.
- Fixed: A bug where videos would not export if either of the image dimensions are odd.


### [v1.0.16-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.0.16-stable)

### [v1.0.15-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.0.15-stable)
- Added: Two New Path Finding Modules for creating Mosaics!
    - "Mosaic Rectangle" - Creates a mosaic of rectangles out of a set of user configurable styles.
    - "Mosaic Voronoi" - Creates a mosaic based on the output of a weighted Voronoi Diagram from a set of user configurable styles.
    - The "User Configurable styles" can have a "weighting" to affect their distribution, there is no limit on the number of different styles per mosaic.
    - Please note: Using Voronoi PFMs for drawing styles can be tempremental.
- Added: Version Control! You can now save your favourite versions of your project as you go and experiment with settings without losing your favourites.
    - There is a "Save Version" button next to the plotting controls, click this when you create something you like, you can then access and reload / save these versions from the "Version Control" panel, which will show a preview of the version the date it was created and the name of the path finding module used.
- Added: Project Loading & Saving! 
    - You can now save your projects and reload them as ".drawingbotv3" files from the "File Menu" - you can also save versions in this way.
    - This saves all elements of the project, like Drawing Size, PFM Settings, Pen Settings & also all of the versions you've created!
    - It doesn't however save the image used to keep the files small but it will save the path to the image used and reload it if it's still available. 
- Fixed: Default presets become replicated when saving new presets.
- Fixed: Broken Sketch PFM Presets, they will now behave as intended again.

### [v1.0.14-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.0.14-stable)

### [v1.0.13-stable](https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3/releases/tag/v1.0.13-stable)
- Added: Four New Path Finding Modules! All of which use much more accurate "Bresenham" calculations this results in longer processing times.
    - "Sketch Quad Beziers" - Builds the image out of the darkest quadratic curves. By first finding the darkest line and finding the darkest control point.
    - "Sketch Cubic Beziers" - Builds the image out of the darkest cubic curves. By first finding the darkest line, and then finding the darkest combination of control both points.
    - "Sketch Catmull-Roms" - Builds the image out of the darkest catmull-rom splines. This works by finding the best possible curve over the next two segments.
    - "Sketch Shapes" - Builds the image out of either Squares of Ellipses.
  
- Changed: The original "Sketch Curves PFM" has had a major revamp and now works almost as well as Catmull Roms, however it uses more basic Bresenham calculations so has a reduced accuracy, but does result in a much faster processing time.
- Fixed: An issue where when hitting "Reset View", it sometimes had to be hit again.
- Fixed: An issue where zooming would behave in strange ways.
- Fixed: Issue where either the last or first shape wasn't drawn, primarily in curve modes.

- Changed: The settings for "Spiral PFM" now have more logical maximums.
- Fixed: Spiral PFM rendering the spiral off-screen.
- Fixed: "Min Line Length" would not always be respected and shorter lines would still be created, this has been fixed and so the defaults of some presets have also changed.
- Fixed: Rounding errors resulting in a less than uniform distribution of random angles, affected most path finding modules.
- Fixed: Line merging in Path Optimisation will now work more like expected.
- Fixed: Issue where completely black would not show up in the SVG output.
