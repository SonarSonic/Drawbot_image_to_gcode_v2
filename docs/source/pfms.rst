Path Finding Modules
======================

The Path Finding Modules (PFMs) are algorithms for converting images into geometric shapes, they can be configured in the **Path Finding Controls** panel.
They have been designed to be as flexible as possible and to run with almost any combination of settings. This means that they can create many more styles than those you see here. Some of these extra styles are included as **presets**!

Every Path Finding Module can also be run with :ref:`cmyk-separation`

Sketch PFMs
----------------------------------------------------

Sketch PFMs are best used for plots using multiple layers of different pens as the Sketch PFMs rely on the different pens to represent the different tones in the image. However, it is possible to use a single pen with Sketch PFMs though it is recommended to use a pen which is additive where overlapping strokes will result in progressively darker lines.

Sketch Lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into lines using brightness data.

Sketch Curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into `catmull-rom splines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline>`_ using brightness data.

    :width: 250pt

Sketch Quad Beziers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into `Quadratic Bézier curves <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Quadratic_B%C3%A9zier_curves>`_ using brightness data, by first finding the darkest line and then finding the darkest position for one control point. It uses more accurate "Bresenham" calculations which results in longer processing times but increased precision.

Sketch Cubic Beziers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into `Cubic Bézier curves <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Cubic_B%C3%A9zier_curves>`_ using brightness data, by first finding the darkest line and then finding the darkest position for the two control points. It uses more accurate "Bresenham" calculations which results in longer processing times but increased precision.

Sketch Catmull-Roms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into `catmull-rom splines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline>`_ using brightness data, by finding the next darkest curve from each point. It uses more accurate "Bresenham" calculations which results in longer processing times but increased precision.

    :width: 250pt

Sketch Sobel Edges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into lines using brightness data & edge detection data. By using a `Sobel Operator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator>`_ to find sharp edges and then using this data in conjunction with the brightness to find the next line.

.. image:: images/sketch_sobel_edges_eye_after.jpg
    :width: 250pt

.. image:: images/sketch_sobel_edges_after.jpg
    :width: 250pt

Sketch Waves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into lines which follow the direction defined by an X and Y curve function.

.. image:: images/sketch_waves_example_1.jpg
    :width: 250pt

How they work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) Find the darkest area of the image
2) Find the darkest pixel in that area
3) Finds the next darkest line from that pixel
4) Brighten the part of the image that the line covers
5) Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the specified **squiggle length** is reached then return to step 1

The process will stop when either the specified **line density** or **max line limit** has been reached.

Settings: *All*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Plotting Resolution**: the factor the original image is scaled by before plotting. Useful in reducing the number/density of lines, also decreased computation time.
- **Random Seed**: used to generate all the random numbers used by the PFM. This means plots will always produce the same results.
- **Line Density**: affects the total number of lines and therefore the computation time
- **Min Line Length**: the minimum length of each line
- **Max Line Length**: the maximum length of each line
- **Max Line Limit**: limits the total number of lines, will only have an effect if this limit is reached before the chosen **line density**
- **Squiggle Length**: defines the total number of connected lines which should be drawn before looking for the next darkest area of the image
- **Adjust Brightness**: the amount to change the pixel's brightness by in the source image when a line is drawn, affects how often the PFM will draw over the same area.
- **Neighbour Tests**: how many drawing angles to test before choosing the darkest line, increase this value to improve the accuracy of the plot, this will increase computation time.
- **Should lift pen**: if the pen should be raised when moving to the next darkest area, disabling this can create some unique styles

Settings: *Lines & Curves Only*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Start Angle *(Min & Max)***: the start angle affects the trajectory of lines, this has less effect when **shading** is disabled.
- **Shading**: when shading is enabled the PFM will draw lines which are limited by the **start angle min/max** creating a diagonal shading effect
- **Shading Threshold**: the point in the processing when shading will kick in, note this ignores **max line limit**
- **Drawing Delta Angle**: the degrees of rotation that the PFM will use when finding the next line while drawing
- **Shading Delta Angle**: the degrees of rotation that the PFM will use when finding the next line while shading

Settings: *Curves & Catmull-Roms Only*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Curve Tension**: affects the tension of the catmull-rom splines

Settings: *Quad & Cubic Beziers Only*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Curve Tests**: the number of positions to test for each control point to find the darkest curve, increasing this will result in a more accurate plot.
- **Curve Variation**: the maximum magnitude of the curve, increasing this will decrease the test accuracy and increase the control points offsets.

Settings: *Sobel Edges Only*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Sobel Intensity**: the priority of edge detection vs brightness
- **Sobel Adjust**: similar to **adjust brightness**, the amount to decrease a pixel's sobel value by when a line is drawn over it, affects how strongly the PFM is affected by the sobel values.

Spiral PFM
---------------------
Transforms an image into a oscillating spiral using brightness data.

.. image:: images/spiral_eye_after.jpg
    :width: 250pt

.. image:: images/spiral_after.jpg
    :width: 250pt

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) Moves to the first point on the spiral.
2) Samples the brightness at the current point and draws a line which is perpendicular to the spiral where the lines length is proportional to the sampled brightness.
3) Move to the next point on the spiral and Repeat step 2.

The process stops when the specified **spiral size** has been reached

Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Plotting Resolution**: the factor the original image is scaled by before plotting. Useful in reducing the number/density of lines, also decreased computation time.
- **Random Seed**: used to generate all the random numbers used by the PFM. This means plots will always produce the same results.
- **Spiral Size**: the size of the generated spiral, a spiral at 100% will just touch the edge of the image.
- **Centre X**: the x position of the centre point of the spiral as a percentage.
- **Centre Y**: the y position of the centre point of the spiral as a percentage.
- **Ring Spacing**: the distance between each generated ring
- **Amplitude**: the scale of the oscillations
- **Density**: *may change* a large density will result in less lines / brightness samples

Adaptive PFMS
------------------------------------------------------------

'Adaptive' are named after the way they adapt to match the tone of the input image.

This means the reproductions of tones is way more accurate then other PFMs, this means they have an additional processing stage "Tone Mapping". This process only needs to be performed once per configuration of settings, if you change a setting which could alter the tone map it will run again.

You can view the output of the tone mapping stage by selecting "Display:" and then "Tone Map", this shows you three outputs the Reference Tone Map, the drawing created by the PFM with the current settings and the blurred version of this output.

**For the best results with Adaptive PFMs use high resolution, high contrast images**

Adaptive Circular Scribbles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transforms an image into a single continuous circular scribble.

This is an implementation of Chiu Et Al 2015, “Tone‐ and Feature‐Aware Circular Scribble Art”. If you wish to achieve results similar to Chiu Et Al’s implementation use a size of paper, pen width which gives you a plotting size of 4000px on the largest edge then use the “Chiu Et Al – 4000px” preset
